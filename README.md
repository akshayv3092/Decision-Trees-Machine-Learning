# Decision-Trees-Machine-Learning

I. Motivation: There is not a single domain where Machine Learning does not find its application, today; among all Banking and Finance extensively use Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics to hunt for prospective customers, granting credit, fraud detection etc., The primary motivation is to understand and apply the approach taken, subtle differences in solving different problems, although in the same domain.

II. Problem Statement:

1. Bank Marketing Dataset - The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). This has 45,211 observations, 17 variables, and Partitioning used 70 % Training, 30% Testing

2. Credit Screening Dataset â€“ The data is related with credit screening of a Japanese credit company. People were asked if they were granted or denied credit. The classification goal is to predict if a person will be granted credit or not (variable A16). The dataset has 690 observations and 16 variables and Partitioning used 70 % Training, 30% Testing.

III. Implications:
1. bank Marketing Dataset - The training error tends to increase as the data is fed to the model, later it reduces gradually. Similarly, the testing error also reduces from 0.1 to 0.093. This implies that the model improves as more and more data is fed into it. However, there is a large difference between training and testing errors, which may be because of overfitting.

2. Credit Screening Dataset - The training error tends to increase as the data is fed to the model, later it reduces gradually. Similarly, the testing error also reduces, however the differences between the two is small, implying no under-fitting or over-fitting.
